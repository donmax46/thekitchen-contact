    <h2>Archive — regional echoes</h2>
    <p class="muted">Fragments, folklore and public-facing stories that speak to place, community and care. These are cultural notes, not operational instructions.</p>

    <article>
      <h3>Desert Fires (Gulf)</h3>
      <p>Stories of nights beneath glass towers — narratives about anonymity, trust, and the social life of cities. This archive keeps the folklore public and reflective.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Island Letters (Australia)</h3>
      <p>Letters and slow-post tales: the way islands and long distances shape how communities speak to each other. This is context, not protocol.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Old Milano</h3>
      <p>Market corners, coffee houses, and the feeling of a city that sleeps with one eye open. Respect, tradition, and careful sharing mark the stories here.</p>
    </article>
