        We are a creative, public-facing space exploring ritual, wellness, and safe practice.
        The public pages are poetic and educational — for any deeper or private conversations
        please use your personal channels. This site aims to preserve folklore, travel stories,
        and harm-reduction material for curious minds.

        <h2>On place & practice</h2>
        <p>
          The Kitchen draws inspiration from cities where craft, travel, and curiosity meet.
          Dubai's skyline and the Gulf's nocturnal hum, Australia's wide coasts and slow mail routes,
          Italy's market corners and old lanes — all shape the rituals we celebrate. Each place
          brings different stories about wellbeing and community; this space reflects on the
          cultural context, tourism and the restorative aspects of travel for the mind.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">— Tourism is mentioned here as cultural context and wellbeing; we do not provide operational or transactional guidance.</p>
